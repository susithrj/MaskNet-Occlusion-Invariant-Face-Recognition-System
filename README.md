## MaskNet-Occluded-face-Recognition-System
MaskNet is an Occluded face recognition system which capable in recognition masked faces. The  project is developed through the research study. the research study can found [here](). 

## Research Results
Please find the research results of MaskNet : Results of the research Oclussion Invariant Face Recognition for masked faces described in the following link. [Results of the research](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Face-Mask-Invariant-Face-Recognition-with-Identity-Verification)

## Setting up the project 
Clone the repository from GitHub

	git clone https://github.com/Ayoob7/facenet-face-recognition.git

Install project requirements

	pip install -r requirements.txt

Run this in the root dir to launch the application.

	python Dashboard.py

This has a extensible, user operable facial recognition application.However, there are limitations with it as well. Anyone wishing to work on the limitations are welcome to do so.
